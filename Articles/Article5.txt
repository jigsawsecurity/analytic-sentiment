The Pratt Regional Medical Center was named the recipient of the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund’s Janet Sevier Gilbreath Special Project Recognition award.

Thursday’s announcement precedes a formal celebration Tuesday.

In a press release, the ministry fund said the selection was because of the health care system’s navigator program, which helps people obtain health care coverage through the marketplace.

In 2016, the hospital guided 1,105 people through the marketplace in several counties: Barber, Barton, Clark, Edwards, Harper, Kingman, Kiowa, Pratt, Rice and Stafford.

Ministry fund President Kim Moore singled-out hospital navigator Lisa Hart.

“Lisa is dedicated to helping people explore their options for coverage through the federally-facilitated marketplace,” Moore said in the release. “And if coverage is not available there, she finds possible community or state resources to which she can refer them.”

According to Moore, a marketplace navigator typically answers questions, helps with completing online applications for financial assistance, compares insurance policies, completes the enrollment for coverage and assists with any post-enrollment issues.

“Fortunately residents in that 10-county area had a navigator like Lisa to guide them through and provide assistance,” Moore said.

The annual award is named to commemorate the first chairperson of the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund Board of Trustees.

The criteria the Health Fund uses for selecting the Janet Sevier Gilbreath Special Project recipient are based on scale, achievement, leverage, operational excellence, benefits to the under served, and social justice and diversity.
