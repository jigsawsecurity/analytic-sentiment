Take Note: SecureWorks Corp. (NASDAQ:SCWX) has hit some technical weakness in its momentum, and while it has not broken down all the way through support -- watch the key levels that we discuss below and further, watch the stochastics and technical oscillators for any kind of momentum gaps. 

The company has a two bull momentum rating which indicates weakness -- but not a full scale breakdown.	There can be a contrarian urge to enter a new long position as the stock drops, but as of this moment, the stock price is moving lower and may yet weaken further. If a reversal becomes apparent, waiting for that strength in the technicals may be more prudent than jumping in as the stock drops. 

The technical rating goes from a rating of one, the weakest upside technical, to a rating of five, the highest upside technical. This is strictly focusing on price and technical -- that means we focus on real-time stock price movement and then position it relative to the simple moving averages. To make the technical rating meaningful, the moving averages are also compared to each other. 

If you're looking for the simplest version of this, here it is -- when the short-term moving averages are above the long-term moving averages that indicates relative strength in the technical. Then see the current price relative to the highest moving average and you will have a "back of the envelope" technical indicator in your back pocket for any stock at any time. 

The blending and weighting of numbers above created the technical model built by Capital Market Laboratories (www.CMLviz.com). Note the stock price at publication ($9.03), since the technical rating is based on intraday stock prices.
